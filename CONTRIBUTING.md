# Community Standards

Our open source project is committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive community for all contributors and users. We expect all members of our community to adhere to the following standards:

## Code of Conduct

Our project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/). This code of conduct outlines our expectations for behavior within the project community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## Communication

We encourage open and respectful communication within our community. We expect all members to communicate in a way that is constructive and respectful, even when disagreements arise. We do not tolerate harassment, hate speech, or discrimination of any kind.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions from all members of our community, regardless of their level of experience or background. We expect all contributions to be respectful and constructive, and to align with our project goals and values.

## Licensing

All contributions to our project must be made under an open source license that is compatible with our project's license. We will not accept contributions that are not properly licensed.

## Moderation

Our project moderators have the right and responsibility to remove any content or contributions that violate our community standards. Moderation decisions will be made fairly and transparently, and appeals may be made to the project maintainers.

## Reporting

If you witness or experience behavior that violates our community standards, please report it to the project moderators. We take all reports seriously and will investigate them promptly.

## Enforcement

We reserve the right to take appropriate action in response to behavior that violates our community standards, up to and including banning individuals from our community. We will always strive to be fair and transparent in our enforcement actions.

By participating in our community, you agree to abide by these community standards. We believe that by working together and treating each other with respect, we can create a welcoming and inclusive community that benefits everyone.
