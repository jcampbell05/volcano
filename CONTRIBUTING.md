GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's an example of a contributing template for an open source project:

# Contributing to [Project Name]

Thank you for your interest in contributing to [Project Name]! We welcome contributions from everyone, regardless of their level of experience or background. By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

To get started contributing, you should first [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the project repository and [clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) it to your local machine. You can then create a new branch for your changes:

```
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

Before making any changes, be sure to read the project documentation and [open issues](https://github.com/your-username/project-name/issues) to see if your contribution is already being worked on or if there are any specific guidelines or requirements for contributions.

## Making Changes

Once you have identified an area to contribute to, you can make your changes and commit them to your local branch. Be sure to write clear and concise commit messages that describe the changes you have made.

Before submitting a pull request, be sure to run any tests or linters that are included in the project to ensure that your changes do not introduce any new issues.

## Submitting a Pull Request

When you are ready to submit your changes, you can create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) from your branch to the main project repository. Be sure to include a clear description of your changes and any relevant context or background information.

Your pull request will be reviewed by the project maintainers, who may request changes or provide feedback. Once your changes have been approved, they will be merged into the main project repository.

## Getting Help

If you have any questions or need help with your contribution, you can reach out to the project maintainers by [opening an issue](https://github.com/your-username/project-name/issues/new) or contacting us through other channels (if available).
