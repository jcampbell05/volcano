# The minimum set of instructions needed for Turing completeness in a RISC architecture can vary, but typically includes:

# 1. Arithmetic operations: `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`
#
# 2. Logic operations: `and`, `or`, `not`, 'xor', 'nand'
# 3. Conditional branch: `bne` or `beq` (branch if not equal or branch if equal)
# 4. Load and store: `lw` (load word), `sw` (store word)
# 5. Shift operations: `sll` (shift left logical), `srl` (shift right logical)
# 6. Set if less than: `slt` (set if less than)
# 7. Add $output to other functions

The "set if greater than" operation can be achieved by using the `slt` instruction and then inverting the result. Here's how you can do it in MIPS assembly:

```assembly
slt $t0, $s1, $s0   # if $s1 < $s0 then $t0 = 1 else $t0 = 0
xori $t0, $t0, 1    # invert the result
```

In this example, `$s0` and `$s1` are the two values being compared. If `$s1` is less than `$s0`, then `$t0` is set to 1; otherwise, it's set to 0. The `xori` instruction is then used to invert the result, effectively implementing a "set if greater than" operation.

# This is a simplified view and actual implementations may require more complex instructions or additional instructions for practical use. Also, note that `mul` and `div` are not strictly necessary for Turing completeness, but they are often included for efficiency.

# Arithmetic operators
#
add() {
    echo $(($1 + $2))
}

sub() {
    echo $(($1 - $2))
}

div() {
    if [ "$2" -ne 0 ]; then
        echo $(($1 / $2))
    else
        echo "Error: Division by zero" >&2
        exit 1
    fi
}

mul() {
    echo $(($1 * $2))
}
